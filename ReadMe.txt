Simple No-IP updater written in python3 that updates your machine IP in the server

Just edit with your noip domain in the form 'mydomain.no-ip.org' or whatever TLD you used,
then put your username and password and run. It will update your IP with the
machine's current IP (the IP of the modem if you're behind a gateay).

It'll use HTTPS :)
